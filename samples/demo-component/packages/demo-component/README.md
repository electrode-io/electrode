# Electrode Demo Component

__COMPONENT DESCRIPTION GOES HERE__


## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [electrode.github.io/demo-component](http://electrode.github.io/demo-component/)

To build the package locally, run:

npm install

```

To run the package demo locally, run the `demo-app` :

```
npm install
clap dev

```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use demo-component is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/demo-component.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install demo-component --save
```

## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.
