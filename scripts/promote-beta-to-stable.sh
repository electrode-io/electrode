# BETA TO STABLE PROMOTION SCRIPT
# ============================================================================
# PURPOSE: Promotes beta releases to stable by merging beta into master
# 
# WHAT IT DOES:
# 1. Creates timestamped stable release branch from master
# 2. Merges beta branch into the release branch
# 3. Removes -beta suffixes from all package versions
# 4. Runs final version bump using Rush
# 5. Validates build and tests
# 6. Commits changes ready for PR to master
#
# USAGE: ./scripts/promote-beta-to-stable.sh
# 
# NEXT STEPS AFTER RUNNING:
# 1. Push the created release branch
# 2. Create PR to master branch
# 3. After PR merge, run: ./scripts/publish-stable.sh
#
# THIS CREATES: release/stable-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS branch
