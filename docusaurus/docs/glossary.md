- Archetypes are encapsulated boilerplates for centralizing your project configurations, workflows, and dependencies. An archetype is an npm module template, which is a “superclass” of a module, think inheritance for npm modules but not one that is used to generate code files and then discarded.

- Caching is a process of storing data locally in order to speed up subsequent retrievals.

- Child component is any component that is contained in a parent component.

- Container based technology is an approach to virtualization in which the virtualization layer runs as an application within the operating system \(OS\). In this approach, the operating system's kernel runs on the hardware node with several isolated guest virtual machines \(VMs\) installed on top of it. The isolated guests are called containers.

- Cross Site Request Forgery \(CSRF\) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request.

- Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.

- Linting is the process of running a program that will analyze code for potential errors.

- Local scope is a CSS Modules feature that keeps classes local to the specified file, and does not pollute the global namespace.

- Markup a notation used to annotate a document's content to give information regarding the structure of the text or instructions for how it is to be displayed.

- Metadata extractor is a type of tooling that retrieves meta data information from various packages.

- Module tree is a directory tree like structure of all the package dependencies of a particular npm/node module.

- Multi instance is a type of architecture where multiple customers run their own separate instance of an application and operating system running on a separate virtual machine, all on a common hardware platform.

- Platform agnostic is software was runs on any combination of operating system and underlying processor architecture.

- Predictable state container is an object that stores the state of the entire app where the only way to change the state tree is to emit an action. Also known as Redux.

- Profiling is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space \(memory\) or time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of function calls.

- Promise is an object used for asynchronous computations. It represents a value that may be available now, in the future, or never.

- React Data Id is a custom attribute used so that React can uniquely identify its components within the Document Object Model \(DOM\).

- Rendering Engine is a program that renders marked up content.

- Route Handler is a method or function that is executed when a certain route was requested. It usually handles the request and returns the necessary HTML to the client.

- Routing is the process of selecting the best paths in a network.

- Scaffolding tool is a tool used to generate a set of files, folders and configurations that follow the most common best practices to start a new project or component.

- Server Side Rendering a process where the initial request loads the page, layout, CSS, JavaScript and content. For subsequent updates to the page, the client-side rendering approach repeats the steps it used to get the initial content.

- Stub is a piece of code used to stand in for some other programming functionality.

- Transform to change in composition or structure.

- Transpile is a type of compilation process that takes the source code of a program written in one programming language as its input and produces the equivalent source code in another programming language.
