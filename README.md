# Web Applications with node.js and React

The Electrode project was developed to make [node.js] and [React] the primary tech choices for developing applications at Walmart. It has been powering the <http://www.walmart.com> eCommerce website since 2017.

Originally designed for Walmart specific use cases, we open-sourced part of Electrode with the hope that it will be useful to some of you in the JavaScript community. This is the same version that is used to power many applications at Walmart.

What we open-sourced here is the web application development part of Electrode. It focuses on building web apps with the following emphases:

- large scale micro-frontend architecture
- universal webapp with server side rendering powered by [node.js]

# Getting Started
