# Electrode React Application Archetype

The application archetype is a pair of npm modules that provide common patterns and configurations for developing a universal React application.  With the application generator, you can quickly create and start developing a React application.  The defaults generally are well suited for many applications, but it is possible to customize some features and enable more advanced features for your specific needs.
