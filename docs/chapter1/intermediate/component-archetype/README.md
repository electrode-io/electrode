# Electrode React Component Archetype

The Electrode Component Archetype helps developers quickly build React components. Recently, the WalmartLabs Electrode team made a significant restructure to the component directory using Lerna to manage the component structure. With the new structure, you can have multiple components inside the package directory and a single demo app to test all the components. Generally, you keep one component in one repo, but you can also have multiple smaller components that complement each other. We also moved demo-server to a directory outside of the packages, imported components from packages, and presented components using the demo app.

Let's go through the most important sections to understand the new Component Archetype together and we will cover how to generate Electrode components by using the latest Electrode generators in the [Create an Electrode Component](/docs/chapter1/intermediate/create-a-electrode-component) section.
