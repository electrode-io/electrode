# More Deployments

Deploying in an efficient, organized, and seamless way is the key to success.
>["Your deploys should be as boring, straightforward, and stress-free as possible"](https://zachholman.com/posts/deploying-software). ...a wise man

We have assembled a few more best-in-class software deployment options with tutorials in this section:

* [Docker](./more-deployments/docker.md), a new container based technology that is designed to make applications easier to [create, deploy and run](https://cloud.docker.com/).

* [Google Kubernetes](./more-deployments/kubernetes.md), "an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of [containerized applications](http://kubernetes.io/)."
